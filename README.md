# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express, HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
For the frontend of the client side portion, the full stack project utilized a combination of Express, HTML, and Javascript to perform various functions. Express and JavaScript were used to create the model, view, and controller modules for the web application that would handle incoming and outgoing requests made in the browser by the user. Then a static HTML page would be retrieved or a handlebars template depending on the type of request being made to the server. The overall result is that the combination of Express, JavaScript, and HTML were utilized in tandem to fulfill browser requests to the server, and outputting the correct information to the client at the frontend. With the SPA, Angular was used in place of Express, HTML, and JavaScript to create a functional user interface for the admin functions of the web application. The major difference between the SPA and the client frontend being that an SPA loads everything to a single-page instead of requiring multiple pages or templates. And that since the SPA relied on Angular, the structure of the project consists of components and services to achieve functionality instead of models, views, and controllers.

# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
A NoSQL MongoDB database was used for the backend of the web application mainly because it is scalable and can be queried easily. This enables the web application to be able to handle incoming requests from a browser quickly and with accuracy so that the client frontend is responsive. MongoDB also works well with JSON formatted documents, which are compatible with frontend applications.

# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is derived from JavaScript as the acronym means "JavaScript Object Notation". But even if it derives from it, JSON is not limited to just the JavaScript language. JSON is really a data formatting specification. The common formats are key/value pairs or ordered lists. JavaScript on the other hand is as mentioned a programming language that can utilize JSON to define objects made with the language. Therefore, using JSON with an API designed with JavaScript language ties the frontend with the backend of the web application. As the frontend API can be used by the client to make requests to the server through JSON to receive the correct data for display.

# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
